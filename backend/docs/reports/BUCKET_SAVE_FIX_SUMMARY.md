# Bucket and Database Save Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Script Files Not Being Saved to Bucket/Scripts
**Problem**: When generating videos from text scripts, the uploaded script files were only saved temporarily and not moved to the `bucket/scripts/` directory or properly saved to the database.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `/generate-video` endpoint to save script files to `bucket/scripts/` using `bhiv_bucket.save_script()`
- Added proper script database entry with `script_id`, `content_id`, and file path
- Script content is now saved both to bucket and Supabase database

### 2. Missing Storyboard Generation and Storage
**Problem**: Storyboards were not being generated or saved during video creation.

**Solution**:
- Added storyboard generation logic that creates structured JSON with scenes and frames
- Storyboards are now saved to `bucket/storyboards/` using `bhiv_bucket.save_storyboard()`
- Each storyboard includes content_id, scenes, duration, and generation metadata

### 3. Tags Not Being Generated Properly
**Problem**: Generated videos had minimal tags and weren't using script content for tag generation.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced tag generation to analyze script content (first 500 characters)
- Added default tags for generated content: `['generated', 'video', 'script']`
- Tags are properly saved to database and used by RL agent

### 4. Ratings Not Being Saved to Bucket
**Problem**: User ratings were only saved to database, not to bucket storage.

**Solution**:
- Modified `/feedback` endpoint to save ratings to `bucket/ratings/` using `bhiv_bucket.save_rating()`
- Rating files include complete feedback data with timestamps
- Maintains both database and bucket storage for redundancy

### 5. Missing Comprehensive Logging
**Problem**: System actions weren't being logged to bucket for audit and debugging.

**Solution**:
- Added generation logs for video creation process
- Added RL training logs for feedback processing
- Added upload logs for file uploads
- All logs saved to `bucket/logs/` with structured JSON format

### 6. Upload Endpoint Not Handling Script Files
**Problem**: When uploading `.txt` files, they weren't being saved to scripts bucket.

**Solution**:
- Modified `/upload` endpoint to detect script files (`.txt` extension)
- Script files are now saved to both `bucket/uploads/` and `bucket/scripts/`
- Script database entries created for uploaded text files

## File Structure After Fix

```
bucket/
├── scripts/          # All script files (.txt)
├── storyboards/      # Generated storyboard JSON files
├── videos/           # Generated video files (.mp4)
├── logs/             # System operation logs
├── ratings/          # User feedback and ratings
├── uploads/          # All uploaded files
└── tmp/              # Temporary files (auto-cleaned)
```

## Database Tables Updated

### Scripts Table
- `script_id`: Unique identifier
- `content_id`: Link to generated content
- `user_id`: User who uploaded/created
- `script_content`: Full text content
- `file_path`: Path to script file in bucket
- `used_for_generation`: Boolean flag

### Content Table
- Enhanced with proper tags from script analysis
- Better descriptions for generated content
- Links to related script files

### Feedback Table
- Unchanged but now also saves to bucket/ratings/

## API Endpoints Enhanced

### POST /generate-video
- Now saves scripts to bucket and database
- Generates and saves storyboards
- Creates comprehensive logs
- Returns script_id and storyboard_path

### POST /upload
- Detects and handles script files specially
- Saves scripts to both uploads and scripts buckets
- Creates script database entries for .txt files

### POST /feedback
- Saves ratings to bucket/ratings/
- Creates RL training logs
- Maintains database storage

## Testing

Run `python simple_test.py` to verify all functionality:
- Bucket initialization
- Script saving
- Storyboard saving  
- Rating saving
- Log saving
- Database connectivity

## Benefits

1. **Complete Data Persistence**: All data now saved to both database and bucket
2. **Better Organization**: Files properly categorized in bucket segments
3. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
4. **Redundancy**: Critical data stored in multiple locations
5. **Debugging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
6. **Analytics**: Better data for system monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Test video generation with script upload
2. Verify all files appear in correct bucket directories
3. Check database entries are created properly
4. Monitor logs for any issues
5. Test feedback system saves ratings to bucket

The system now properly saves all components (scripts, storyboards, tags, logs, ratings) to both bucket storage and Supabase database as required.
